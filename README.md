# utilityplugin
Meh, just exists here for CherryMC / Ch3rryMC, made this a repo so ppl could inspect the source.

UtilityPlugin is one of my hobby projects, i do it for fun because i want to, Feel free to use this however you want as long as it's not being used to build atomic weapons
or nuclear bombs.


(This was made using IntellIJ IDEA, i suggest you use that to inspect / edit it.)
